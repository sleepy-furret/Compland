# Compland
An RPG game by Sleepy Furret. But now its named Center temporarly.

Okay, so, It was a strugle to get this working. I hope that after i restart the computer the project still runs.
nd it is not 100% yet. But it is runable, so i can go work in the project!
I'm still working in it, so, in case the game is not 100% polished, it is for this reason.
If you want to suport me, you can talk with me in my Discord server. It's Furretalk, here is the invite link: https://discord.gg/Vja6qwMyYy
